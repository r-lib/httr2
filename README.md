httr2 is a ground-up rewrite of [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org) that
provides a pipeable API with an explicit request object that solves more
problems felt by packages that wrap APIs (e.g. built-in rate-limiting,
retries, OAuth, secure secrets, and more).

## Installation

You can install httr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("httr2")
```

## Usage

To use httr2, start by creating a **request**:

``` r
library(httr2)

req <- request("https://r-project.org")
req
#> <httr2_request>
#> GET https://r-project.org
#> Body: empty
```

You can tailor this request with the `req_` family of functions:

``` r
# Add custom headers
req %>% req_headers("Accept" = "application/json")
#> <httr2_request>
#> GET https://r-project.org
#> Headers:
#> • Accept: 'application/json'
#> Body: empty

# Add a body, turning it into a POST
req %>% req_body_json(list(x = 1, y = 2))
#> <httr2_request>
#> POST https://r-project.org
#> Body: json encoded data

# Automatically retry if the request fails
req %>% req_retry(max_tries = 5)
#> <httr2_request>
#> GET https://r-project.org
#> Body: empty
#> Policies:
#> • retry_max_tries: 5

# Change the HTTP method
req %>% req_method("PATCH")
#> <httr2_request>
#> PATCH https://r-project.org
#> Body: empty
```

And see exactly what httr2 will send to the server with `req_dry_run()`:

``` r
req %>% req_dry_run()
#> GET / HTTP/1.1
#> Host: r-project.org
#> User-Agent: httr2/0.1.1 r-curl/4.3.2 libcurl/7.79.1
#> Accept: */*
#> Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip
```

Use `req_perform()` to perform the request, retrieving a **response**:

``` r
resp <- req_perform(req)
resp
#> <httr2_response>
#> GET https://www.r-project.org/
#> Status: 200 OK
#> Content-Type: text/html
#> Body: In memory (6158 bytes)
```

The `resp_` functions help you extract various useful components of the
response:

``` r
resp %>% resp_content_type()
#> [1] "text/html"
resp %>% resp_status_desc()
#> [1] "OK"
resp %>% resp_body_html()
#> {html_document}
#> <html lang="en">
#> [1] <head>\n<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...
#> [2] <body>\n    <div class="container page">\n      <div class="row">\n       ...
```

## Major differences to httr

-   You can now create and modify a request without performing it. This
    means that there’s now a single function to perform the request and
    fetch the result: `req_perform()`. (If you want to handle the
    response as it streams in, use `req_stream()` instead).
    `req_perform()` replaces `httr::GET()`, `httr::POST()`,
    `httr::DELETE()`, and more.

-   HTTP errors are automatically converted into R errors. Use
    `req_error()` to override the defaults (which turn all 4xx and 5xx
    responses into errors) or to add additional details to the error
    message.

-   You can automatically retry if the request fails or encounters a
    transient HTTP error (e.g. a 429 rate limit request). `req_retry()`
    defines the maximum number of retries, which errors are transient,
    and how long to wait between tries.

-   OAuth support has been totally overhauled to directly support many
    more flows and to make it much easier to both customise the built-in
    flows and to create your own.

-   You can manage secrets (often needed for testing) with
    `secret_encrypt()` and friends. You can obfuscate mildly
    confidential data with `obfuscate()`, preventing it from being
    scraped from published code.

-   You can automatically cache all cacheable results with
    `req_cache()`. Relatively few API responses are cacheable, but when
    they are it typically makes a big difference.

much useful feedback on both the design of the internals and the user
facing API.
