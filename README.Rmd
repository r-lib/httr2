httr2 is a ground-up rewrite of [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org) that provides a pipeable API with an explicit request object that solves more problems felt by packages that wrap APIs (e.g. built-in rate-limiting, retries, OAuth, secure secrets, and more).

## Installation

You can install httr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("httr2")
```

## Usage

To use httr2, start by creating a **request**:

```{r}
library(httr2)

req <- request("https://r-project.org")
req
```

You can tailor this request with the `req_` family of functions:

```{r}
# Add custom headers
req %>% req_headers("Accept" = "application/json")

# Add a body, turning it into a POST
req %>% req_body_json(list(x = 1, y = 2))

# Automatically retry if the request fails
req %>% req_retry(max_tries = 5)

# Change the HTTP method
req %>% req_method("PATCH")
```

And see exactly what httr2 will send to the server with `req_dry_run()`:

```{r}
req %>% req_dry_run()
```

Use `req_perform()` to perform the request, retrieving a **response**:

```{r}
resp <- req_perform(req)
resp
```

The `resp_` functions help you extract various useful components of the response:

```{r}
resp %>% resp_content_type()
resp %>% resp_status_desc()
resp %>% resp_body_html()
```

## Major differences to httr

-   You can now create and modify a request without performing it.
    This means that there's now a single function to perform the request and fetch the result: `req_perform()`.
    (If you want to handle the response as it streams in, use `req_stream()` instead).
    `req_perform()` replaces `httr::GET()`, `httr::POST()`, `httr::DELETE()`, and more.
  
-   HTTP errors are automatically converted into R errors.
    Use `req_error()` to override the defaults (which turn all 4xx and 5xx responses into errors) or to add additional details to the error message.

-   You can automatically retry if the request fails or encounters a transient HTTP error (e.g. a 429 rate limit request).
    `req_retry()` defines the maximum number of retries, which errors are transient, and how long to wait between tries.

-   OAuth support has been totally overhauled to directly support many more flows and to make it much easier to both customise the built-in flows and to create your own.

-   You can manage secrets (often needed for testing) with `secret_encrypt()` and friends.
    You can obfuscate mildly confidential data with `obfuscate()`, preventing it from being scraped from published code.

-   You can automatically cache all cacheable results with `req_cache()`.
    Relatively few API responses are cacheable, but when they are it typically makes a big difference.

httr2 wouldn't be possible without [curl](https://jeroen.cran.dev/curl/), [openssl](https://github.com/jeroen/openssl/), [jsonlite](https://jeroen.cran.dev/jsonlite/), and [jose](https://github.com/r-lib/jose/), which are all maintained by [Jeroen Ooms](https://github.com/jeroen).
A big thanks also go to [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org) and [Craig Citro](https://research.google/people/CraigCitro/) who have given me much useful feedback on both the design of the internals and the user facing API.
