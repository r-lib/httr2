# httr2 (development version)

* New `req_perform_connection()` for working with streaming data. Unlike `req_perform_stream()` which uses callbacks, `req_perform_connection()` returns a regular response object with a connection as the body. It's paired with `resp_stream_bytes()`, `resp_stream_lines()`, and `resp_stream_sse()` that allows you to stream chunks as you want them. Unlike `req_perform_stream()` it supports `req_retry()` (with @jcheng5, #519).

# httr2 1.0.3

* `jwt_encode_hmac()` now calls correct underlying function
  `jose::jwt_encode_hmac()` and has correct default size parameter value
  (@denskh, #508).

* `req_cache()` now prunes cache _before_ checking if a given key exists,
  eliminating the occassional error about reading from an invalid RDS file.
  It also no longer tests for existence then later reads the cache, avoiding
  potential race conditions.

* New `req_perform_promise()` creates a `promises::promise` so a request can
  run in the background (#501, @gergness).

* `req_perform_parallel()` now respects error handling in `req_error()`.

# httr2 1.0.2

* `req_body_file()` now only opens a connection when the request actually needs data. In particular, this makes it work better with `req_perform_parallel()` (#487).
* `req_cache()` no longer fails if the `rds` files are somehow corrupted and now defaults the `debug` argument to the `httr2_cache_debug` option to make it easier to debug caching buried in other people's code (#486).
* `req_oauth_password()` now only asks for your password once (#498).
* `req_perform_parallel()` now works correctly with `req_cache()` (#447) and now works when downloading 0 byte files (#478)
* `req_perform_stream()` no longer applies the `callback` to unsuccessful
  responses, instead creating a regular response. It also now sets `last_request()` and `last_response()` (#479).
* `req_url_query()` now allows you to opt out of escaping for multi-value parameters (#404).

# httr2 1.0.1

* `req_perform_stream()` gains a `round = c("byte", "line")` argument to control
  how the stream is rounded (#437).

* `req_retry()` gives a clearer error if `after` returns the wrong type of
  value (#385).

* `req_template()` now works when you have a bare `:` in a template that
  uses "uri" style (#389).

* `req_timeout()` now resets the value of `connecttimeout` set by curl.
  This ensures that you can use `req_timeout()` to increase the connection
  timeout past 10s (#395).

* `url_parse()` is considerably faster thanks to performance optimisations
  by and discussion with @DyfanJones (#429).

# httr2 1.0.0

## Function lifecycle

* `local_mock()` and `with_mock()` have been deprecated in favour of
  `local_mocked_responses()` and `with_mocked_responses()` (#301).

* `multi_req_perform()` is deprecated in favour of `req_perform_parallel()`.
  `req_stream()` is deprecated in favour of `req_perform_stream()` (#314).

* `oauth_flow_auth_code()` deprecates `host_name` and `port` arguments in favour
  of using `redirect_uri`. It also deprecates `host_ip` since it seems unlikely
  that changing this is ever useful.

* `oauth_flow_auth_code_listen()` now takes a single `redirect_uri` argument
  instead of separate `host_ip` and `port` arguments. This is a breaking change
  but I don't expect anyone to call this function directly (which was confirmed
  by a GitHub search) so I made the change without deprecation.

* `req_body_form()` and `req_body_multipart()` now require data `...`;
  they no longer accept a single list for compatibility with the 0.1.0
  API.

## Multiple requests

* New `req_perform_sequential()` performs a known set of requests
  sequentially. It has an interface similar to `req_perform_parallel()` but
  with no limitations, and the cost of being slower (#361).

* New `req_perform_iterative()` performs multiple requests, where each request
  is derived from the previous response (@mgirlich, #8).

* `req_perform_parallel()` replaces `multi_req_perform()` to match the new
  naming scheme (#314). It gains a `progress` argument.

* `req_perform_iterative()`, `req_perform_parallel()`, and
  `req_perform_sequential()` share a new error handling strategy. By
  default, errors will be bubbled up, but you can choose an alternative
  strategy with the `on_error` argument (#372).

* A new family of functions `resps_successes()`, `resps_failures()`,
  `resps_requests()` and `resps_data()` make it easier to work with lists of
  responses (#357). Behind the scenes, these work because the request is now
  stored in the response (or error) object (#357).

* `resp_body_json()` and `resp_body_xml()` now cache the parsed values so
  that you can use them repeatedly without worrying about the performance cost.
  This supports the design `req_perform_iterative()` by avoiding the need to
  carefully pass around a parsed object.

## OAuth features

* A new `vignette("oauth")` gives many more details about how OAuth works and
  how to use it with httr2 (#234), and the OAuth docs have been overhauled to
  make it more clear that you should use `req_oauth_*()`, not `oauth_*()` (#330).

* If you are using an OAuth token with a refresh token, and that refresh
  token has expired, then httr2 will now re-run the entire flow to get
  you a new token (#349).

* New `oauth_cache_path()` returns the path that httr2 uses for caching OAuth
  tokens. Additionally, you can now change the cache location by setting the
  `HTTR2_OAUTH_CACHE` env var. This is now more obvious to the user, because
  httr2 now informs the user whenever a token is cached.

* `oauth_flow_auth_code()` gains a `redirect_uri` argument rather than deriving
  this URL automatically from the `host_name` and `port` (#248). It uses
  this argument to automatically choose which strategy to use to get the
  auth code, either launching a temporary web server or, new, allowing you to
  manually enter the details with the help of a custom JS/HTML page hosted
  elsewhere, or by copying and pasting the URL you're redirected to
  (@fh-mthomson, #326). The temporary web server now also respects the path
  component of `redirect_uri`, if the API needs a specific path (#149).

* New `oauth_token_cached()` allows you to get an OAuth token while still
  taking advantage of httr2's caching and auto-renewal features. For expert
  use only (#328).

## Other new features

* @mgirlich is now a httr2 contributor in recognition of his many contributions.

* `req_cache()` gains `max_n`, `max_size`, and `max_age` arguments to
  automatically prune the cache. By default, the cache will stay under 1 GB
  (#207).

* New `req_body_json_modify()` allows you to iteratively modify a JSON
  body of a request.

* New `req_cookie_preserve()` lets you use a file to share cookies across
  requests (#223).

* New `req_progress()` adds a progress bar to long downloads or uploads (#20).

* New `resp_check_content_type()` to check response content types (#190).
  `resp_body_json()` and friends give better errors if no `Content-Type`
  header is present in the response (#284).

* New `resp_has_body()` returns a `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on whether
  or not the response has a body (#205).

* New `resp_url()`, `resp_url_path()`, `resp_url_queries()` and
  `resp_url_query()` to extract various part of the response url (#57).

* `req_url_query()` gains a `.multi` parameter that controls what happens when
  you supply multiple values in a vector. The default will continue to error
  but you can use `.multi = "comma"` to separate with commas, `"pipe"` to
  separate with `|`, and `"explode"` to generate one parameter for each
  value (e.g. `?a=1&a=2`) (#350).

* New `secret_encrypt_file()` and `secret_decrypt_file()` for encrypting and
  decrypting files (#237).

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* The httr2 examples now only run on R 4.2 and later so that we can use
  the base pipe and lambda syntax (#345).

* OAuth errors containing a url now correctly display that URL
  (instead of the string "uri").

* `curl_translate()` now uses the base pipe, and produces escapes with single
  quotes or raw strings in case double quotes can't be used (@mgirlich, #264).
  It gains the argument `simplify_headers` that removes some common but
  unimportant headers, like `Sec-Fetch-Dest` or `sec-ch-ua-mobile`
  (@mgirlich, #256). It also parses the query components of the url
  (@mgirlich, #259) and works with multiline commands from the clipboard
  (@mgirlich, #254).

* `local_mocked_responses()` and `with_mocked_responses()` now accept a
  list of responses which will be returned in sequence. They also now correctly
  trigger errors when the mocked response represents an HTTP failure (#252).

* `oauth_flow_refresh()` now only warns, not errors, if the `refresh_token`
  changes, making it a little easier to use in manual workflows (#186).

* `obfuscated()` values now display their original call when printed.

* `req_body_json()` gains custom content `type` argument
  and respects custom content-type set in header (@mgirlich, #189).

* `req_cache()` now combine the headers of the new response with the headers
  of the cached response. In particular, this fixes `resp_body_json/xml/html()`
  on cached responses (@mgirlich, #277).

 * `req_perform()` now throws error with class `httr2_failure/httr2_error` if
  the request fails, and that error now captures the curl error as the parent.
  If the request succeeds, but the response is an HTTP error, that error
  now also has super class `httr2_error`. This means that all errors thrown by
  httr2 now inherit from the `httr2_error` class. See new docs in `?req_error()`
  for more details.

* `req_perform()`'s progress bar can be suppressed by setting
  `options(httr2_progress = FALSE)` (#251). Progress bars displayed while
  waiting for some time to pass now tell you why they're waiting (#206).

* `req_oauth_bearer_jwt()` now includes the claim in the cache key (#192).

* `req_oauth_device()` now takes a `auth_url` parameter making it usable
  (#331, @taerwin).

* `req_url_query()` gains a `.multi` parameter that controls what happens when
  you supply multiple values in a vector. The default will continue to error
  but you can use `.multi = "comma"` to separate with commas, `"pipe"` to
  separate with `|`, and `"explode"` to generate one parameter for each
  value (e.g. `?a=1&a=2`) (#350).

# httr2 0.2.3

* New `example_url()` to launch a local server, making tests and examples
  more robust.

* New `throttle_status()` to make it a little easier to verify what's happening
  with throttling.

* `req_oauth_refresh()` now respects the `refresh_token` for caching
  (@mgirlich, #178).

* `req_perform()` now always sleeps before a request, rather than after it.
  It also gains an `error_call` argument and communicates more clearly
  where the error occurred (@mgirlich, #187).

* `req_url_path()` and `req_url_path_append()` can now handle `NULL` or empty
  `...` and the elements of `...` can also have length > 1 (@mgirlich, #177).

* `sys_sleep()` (used by `req_retry()` and `req_throttle()`) gains a progress
  bar (#202).

# httr2 0.2.2

* `curl_translate()` can now handle curl copied from Chrome developer tools
  (@mgirlich, #161).

* `req_oauth_*()` can now refresh OAuth tokens. One, two, or even more times!
  (@jennybc, #166)

* `req_oauth_device()` can now work in non-interactive environments,
  as intendend (@flahn, #170)

* `req_oauth_refresh()` and `oauth_flow_refresh()` now use the envvar
  `HTTR2_REFRESH_TOKEN`, not `HTTR_REFRESH_TOKEN` (@jennybc, #169).

* `req_proxy()` now uses the appropriate authentication option (@jl5000).

* `req_url_query()` can now opt out of escaping with `I()` (@boshek, #152).

* Can now print responses where content type is the empty string
  (@mgirlich, #163).

# httr2 0.2.1

* "Wrapping APIs" is now an article, not a vignette.

* `req_template()` now appends the path instead of replacing it (@jchrom, #133)

# httr2 0.2.0

## New features

* `req_body_form()`, `req_body_multipart()`, and `req_url_query()` now
  support multiple arguments with the same name (#97, #107).

* `req_body_form()`, `req_body_multipart()`, now match the interface of
  `req_url_query()`, taking name-value pairs in `...`. Supplying a single
  `list()` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

* `req_body_json()` now overrides the existing JSON body, rather than
  attempting to merge with the previous value (#95, #115).

* Implement `req_proxy()` (owenjonesuob, #77).

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* `httr_path` class renamed to `httr2_path` to correctly match package name
  (#99).

* `oauth_flow_device()` gains PKCE support (@flahn, #92), and
  the interactive flow is a little more user friendly.

* `req_error()` can now correct force successful HTTP statuses to fail (#98).

* `req_headers()` will now override `Content-Type` set by `req_body_*()` (#116).

* `req_throttle()` correctly sets throttle rate (@jchrom, #101).

* `req_url_query()` never uses scientific notation for queries (#93).

* `req_perform()` now respects `httr::with_verbose()` (#85).

* `response()` now defaults `body` to `raw(0)` for consistency with real
  responses (#100).

* `req_stream()` no longer throws an error for non 200 http status codes (@DMerch, #137)

# httr2 0.1.1

* Fix R CMD check failures on CRAN

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
