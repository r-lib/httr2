\title{Preserve cookies across requests}
\usage{
req_cookie_preserve(req, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{req}{A httr2 \link{request} object.}

\item{path}{A path to a file where cookies will be read from before and updated after the request.}
}
\description{
By default, httr2 uses a clean slate for every request meaning that cookies
are not automatically preserved across requests. To preserve cookies, you
must set a cookie file which will be read before and updated after each
request.
}
\examples{
path <- tempfile()
httpbin <- request(example_url()) |>
  req_cookie_preserve(path)

# Manually set two cookies
httpbin |>
  req_template("/cookies/set/:name/:value", name = "chocolate", value = "chip") |>
  req_perform() |>
  resp_body_json()

httpbin |>
  req_template("/cookies/set/:name/:value", name = "oatmeal", value = "raisin") |>
  req_perform() |>
  resp_body_json()

# The cookie path has a straightforward format
cat(readChar(path, nchars = 1e4))
}
