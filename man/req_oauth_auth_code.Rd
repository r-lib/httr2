}
\arguments{
\item{req}{A \link{request}.}

\item{client}{An \code{\link[=oauth_client]{oauth_client()}}.}

\item{auth_url}{Authorization url; you'll need to discover this by reading
the documentation.}

\item{cache_disk}{Should the access token be cached on disk? This reduces
the number of times that you need to re-authenticate at the cost of
storing access credentials on disk. Cached tokens are encrypted,
automatically deleted 30 days after creation, and stored in
\code{\link[=oauth_cache_path]{oauth_cache_path()}}.}

\item{cache_key}{If you want to cache multiple tokens per app, use this
key to disambiguate them.}

\item{scope}{Scopes to be requested from the resource owner.}

\item{pkce}{Use "Proof Key for Code Exchange"? This adds an extra layer of
security and should always be used if supported by the server.}

\item{auth_params}{List containing additional parameters passed to \code{oauth_flow_auth_code_url()}}

\item{token_params}{List containing additional parameters passed to the
\code{token_url}.}

\item{redirect_uri}{URL to redirect back to after authorization is complete.
Often this must be registered with the API in advance.

httr2 supports two forms of redirect. Firstly, you can use a \code{localhost}
url (the default), where httr2 will set up a temporary webserver to listen
for the OAuth redirect. In this case, httr2 will automatically append a
random port. If you need to set it to a fixed port because the API requires
it, then specify it with (e.g.) \code{"http://localhost:1011"}. This technique
works well when you are working on your own computer.

Alternatively, you can provide a URL to a website that uses javascript to
give the user a code to copy and paste back into the R session (see
\url{https://www.tidyverse.org/google-callback/}, for an example). This is
less convenient (because it requires more user interaction) but also works
in hosted environments.}

\item{host_name, host_ip, port}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}
Now use \code{redirect_uri} instead.}

\value{
A modified HTTP \link{request}.

\description{
This uses \code{\link[=oauth_flow_auth_code]{oauth_flow_auth_code()}} to generate an access token, which is
then used to authentication the request with \code{\link[=req_auth_bearer_token]{req_auth_bearer_token()}}.
The token is automatically cached (either in memory or on disk) to minimise
the number of times the flow is performed.

Learn more about the overall flow in \code{vignette("oauth")}.

\section{Security considerations}{
The authorization code flow is used for both web applications and native
applications (which are equivalent to R packages).
\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252}{rfc8252} spells out
important considerations for native apps. Most importantly there's no way
for native apps to keep secrets from their users. This means that the
server should either not require a \code{client_secret} (i.e. a public client
not an confidential client) or ensure that possession of the \code{client_secret}
doesn't bestow any meaningful rights.

Only modern APIs from the bigger players (Azure, Google, etc) explicitly
native apps. However, in most cases, even for older APIs, possessing the
\code{client_secret} gives you no ability to do anything harmful, so our
general principle is that it's fine to include it in an R package, as long
as it's mildly obfuscated to protect it from credential scraping. There's
no incentive to steal your client credentials if it takes less time to
create a new client than find your client secret.
