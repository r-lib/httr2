\title{Perform a list of requests in parallel}
\usage{
req_perform_parallel(
  reqs,
  paths = NULL,
  pool = NULL,
  on_error = c("stop", "return", "continue"),
  progress = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reqs}{A list of \link{request}s.}

\item{paths}{An optional character vector of paths, if you want to download
the response bodies to disk. If supplied, must be the same length as
\code{reqs}.}

\item{pool}{Optionally, a curl pool made by \code{\link[curl:multi]{curl::new_pool()}}. Supply
this if you want to override the defaults for total concurrent connections
(100) or concurrent connections per host (6).}

\item{on_error}{What should happen if one of the requests fails?
\itemize{
\item \code{stop}, the default: stop iterating with an error.
\item \code{return}: stop iterating, returning all the successful responses
received so far, as well as an error object for the failed request.
\item \code{continue}: continue iterating, recording errors in the result.
}}

\item{progress}{Display a progress bar for the status of all requests? Use
\code{TRUE} to turn on a basic progress bar, use a string to give it a name,
or see \link{progress_bars} to customize it in other ways. Not compatible with
\code{\link[=req_progress]{req_progress()}}, as httr2 can only display a single progress bar at a
time.}
}
\value{
A list, the same length as \code{reqs}, containing \link{response}s and possibly
error objects, if \code{on_error} is \code{"return"} or \code{"continue"} and one of the
responses errors. If \code{on_error} is \code{"return"} and it errors on the ith
request, the ith element of the result will be an error object, and the
remaining elements will be \code{NULL}. If \code{on_error} is \code{"continue"}, it will
be a mix of requests and error objects.

Only httr2 errors are captured; see \code{\link[=req_error]{req_error()}} for more details.
}
\description{
This variation on \code{\link[=req_perform_sequential]{req_perform_sequential()}} performs multiple requests in
parallel. Exercise caution when using this function; it's easy to pummel a
server with many simultaneous requests. Only use it with hosts designed to
serve many files at once, which are typically web servers, not API servers.

\code{req_perform_parallel()} has a few limitations:
\itemize{
\item Will not retrieve a new OAuth token if it expires part way through
the requests.
\item Does not perform throttling with \code{\link[=req_throttle]{req_throttle()}}.
\item Does not attempt retries as described by \code{\link[=req_retry]{req_retry()}}.
\item Only consults the cache set by \code{\link[=req_cache]{req_cache()}} before/after all requests.
}

If any of these limitations are problematic for your use case, we recommend
\code{\link[=req_perform_sequential]{req_perform_sequential()}} instead.

\examples{
# Requesting these 4 pages one at a time would take 2 seconds:
request_base <- request(example_url())
reqs <- list(
  request_base |> req_url_path("/delay/0.5"),
  request_base |> req_url_path("/delay/0.5"),
  request_base |> req_url_path("/delay/0.5"),
  request_base |> req_url_path("/delay/0.5")
)
# But it's much faster if you request in parallel
system.time(resps <- req_perform_parallel(reqs))

# req_perform_parallel() will fail on error
reqs <- list(
  request_base |> req_url_path("/status/200"),
  request_base |> req_url_path("/status/400"),
  request("FAILURE")
)
try(resps <- req_perform_parallel(reqs))

# but can use on_error to capture all successful results
resps <- req_perform_parallel(reqs, on_error = "continue")

# Inspect the successful responses
resps |> resps_successes()

# And the failed responses
resps |> resps_failures() |> resps_requests()
}
